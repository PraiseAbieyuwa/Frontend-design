                    <dd><p>My Name is Praise Abieyuwa Alohan with Alt school ID: <b>ALT/SOE/023/2120</b>
                    and this is my story. 
                    My second Attempt on HTml and Css.</p>
                    <p>My First Attempt was after I dropped out of Alx (yikes) and decided to learn Myself
                    Cheers to giving it more trials. Software Eng. is not for the faint hearted</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>I never had intentions of joining Alt school until I dropped out of ALX 
                            and my mates were running their last semester in ALX,
                            I knew it was time to give myself another chance.
                        </p>
                        <p>Like I said, Alx was my major goal but I faced Roadblocks when I got to month three and made a tough decision</p>
                        <ul>
                
                            <li>Continue ALX without understanding and dealing with mental breakdown.</li>
                            <nbsp> OR</nbsp>
                            <li>Enroll in a new Program that is less time consuming and Flexible</li>
                            <li>Give Programming a second chance</li>
                        </ul>
                        <P>Alt School became my second Option and self teaching is my Last one</P>
                        <p>I know none of this path is easy but I believe I can gain a lot from it</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>If I was asked why I choose to learn programming/ work in Tech a year ago, 
                            I believe my answer will be the same as any Nigerian struggling to make ends meet.
                            <br>I wanted to get into Tech especially the technical side cause of opportunities</br>
                        </p>
                        <p>As someone who likes to stay curious I realized its Important to learn 
                            something I can always upskills 
                        </p>
                        <p>In no particular order I believe this is my end goal for Alt School and 
                            Learning to Code in general
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choose between Backend or Cloud Engineering</li>
                            <li>Get an international role with my sales background</li>
                            <li>A lifetime skillset that can easily be upskilled</li>
